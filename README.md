Using Machine Learning to Detect Breast Cancer

Breast Cancer Detection

Understanding Breast Cancer
Breast cancer arises from mutations in genes that regulate cell growth, leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation. While commonly associated with women, men can also develop breast cancer, albeit less frequently.

Statistics
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women globally, with over 2 million new cases in 2018.
Incidence rates vary across regions, with Asia, Africa, and North America showing differing percentages of new cases and mortality rates.
Incidence Rates per 100,000 Women:

Highest: The Netherlands, France, and the U.S. (for white individuals)
Lowest: Thailand, Algeria, and India
(Data from Global Cancer Facts and Figures, 3rd Edition, page 42)

In the U.S. alone, it's estimated that in 2019:

About 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women.
About 62,930 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) will be diagnosed.
About 41,760 women will die from breast cancer.
Machine Learning's Role in Breast Cancer Detection
Mammograms, while effective, have limitations such as false positives/negatives and radiation exposure. Machine learning models, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), offer promising results in breast cancer detection. By training these models on datasets like the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, accuracy rates of up to 97% have been achieved.

Project Overview
This project, inspired by the work of Dr. Ahmet MERT, Dr. Erdem Bilgili, and Dr. Aydin Akan, focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. Utilizing SVM, the project achieved an accuracy of 96%, which increased to 97% after optimization.
